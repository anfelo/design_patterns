# Notes

- Design Patterns are typically OOP-based
- Go is not OOP
  - No inheritance
  - Weak encapsulation
- Permissive visibility/naming
- Use of OOP-ish terminology
  - Hierarchy implies a set of related types: shared interface, embedding
  - Properties are a combination of getter/setter methods
